Welcome to the JiT workshop. Even if compilation and interpreters ayatollahs found something wrong with it, its main goal is to make interpreted languages and JiT accessible to the largest number as possible. You just need to have notions about C language.

You can start the workshop with a short reminder [here](http://jit.bauzac.net/blog/reminder).
