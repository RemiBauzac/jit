Welcome to the JiT workshop. Even if compilation and interpreters ayatollahs found something wrong with it, its main goal is to make interpreted languages and JiT accessible to the largest number as possible. You just need to have notions about C language. All over the articles, I use the famous [Lua](http://lua.org) language as example (I love it). Even if I need to describe how Lua works, the articles are not byte by byte description of Lua. If you find a mistake about it, please let me know.

You can start the workshop with a bit of theory [here](http://jit.bauzac.net/blog/reminder).
